class MetricFilter(PrimitiveActor):
    '''**MetricFilter is a MetricFactory filter to filter or rename metric names.***
    
    MetricFilter allows certain metrics to be dropped or metrics names to be
    rewritten in transit.  This can be practical when dealing with metrics coming
    from different sources.    
    
    metric = {  "type":string,
                "time":time(),
                "source":string,
                "name":string,
                "value":string,
                "units":string,
                "tags":list
                }
    
    
    Parameters:
    
        - name (str):   The instance name when initiated.
        - meta (bool):  When True, drops data with version 128
    
    Queues:
    
        - inbox:    Incoming events.
        - outbox:   Outgoing events.
