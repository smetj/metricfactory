class RabbitMQ(Actor):
    '''**Decode RabbitMQ metrics.**

    This module takes a JSON formatted coming from a RabbitMQ
    clusternode and converts the metrics into the common format.

    The name of the metric will be point delimited.

    Parameters:

        - name (str):           The instance name.
        - source(str):          Allows to set the source manually.
                                Default: rabbitmq

    Queues:

        - inbox:    Incoming events.
        - outbox:   Outgoing events.

    It's possible to process metrics coming from following resources:

        - /api/nodes
        - /api/queues
